Guidelines to provide better customer experience.

1. Always use an AI to polish the message/email before sending it to customer.
1. Always begin the work with designing UI/UX for all supported devices before the development.
1. Deliver work to the customer only when you feel 100% satisfied with the quality of work, never let anything make you compromise on the software quality.
